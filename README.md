## Howdy!
I go by a few different names, including Logan H-D, NotQuiteApex, or just Apex.

* I usually write Python or C++, but can also write Embedded C (Arduino/AVR), Java, Rust, Javascript/HTML5.
* I'm well experienced with HTTP REST API's, Git, Docker, Terraform, and AWS (mostly ECS, EC2, and S3, with some IAM).
* I normally run Windows on my desktop machine, but I use Linux for any other machine I can like my laptop.
* I also stream on Twitch.tv with my friends, under the group name Friend Team Inc., and develop software that we need to manage our community such as VodBot, our website, managing game servers, moderation bots, and more.

## Some professional bits...
* I am a current student at Purdue University, studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, specializing in software engineering.
* I have professional desk job experience with a small local startup, where I learned much about Terraform and AWS, and am continuing to work closely with.
* If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out through my email.
