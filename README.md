## Howdy!
I go by a few different names, including Logan H-D, NotQuiteApex, or just Apex. This is my personal code project page.

* My projects generally stick to languages like C++ and Embedded C, Python, Lua, and am currently learning Rust. I also have experience with Java 8+.
* I'm well experienced with programs and services like Git (command line), REST API's, Docker, Packer, Terraform, and AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, and IAM).
* I usually run Windows on my desktop machine, but I use Linux for any other machine I can like my laptop.
* I also stream on Twitch.tv with my friends, under the group name Friend Team Inc., and develop software that we need to manage our community such as VodBot, our website, managing game servers, moderation bots, and more.

## Some professional bits...
* I am a Bachelor of Science from Purdue University, specializing in Computer Science.
* I work remote (mostly) for a local startup managing AWS infrastructure and programming in Java building backend software for Salesforce.
* If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out through my email.
