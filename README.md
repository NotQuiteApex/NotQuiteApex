### Hey, I'm Logan (or Apex)! (pronouns: he/him)
I do a lot of Embedded C, C++, Python, Lua; and am learning Rust, C#, and Java, in my free time. I've got lots of experience in using REST APIs in all sorts of languages.

I'm currently pursuing my BS Computer Science degree at Purdue University, with plans to specialize in systems software and software engineering. I also stream on Twitch.tv as a hobby under this name, mostly games and talking with friends.
