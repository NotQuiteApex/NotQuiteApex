## Howdy, I'm Logan (he/him) ðŸ‘‹
I go by a few different names, including Logan, NotQuiteApex, or just Apex.

* I'm a software engineer with lots of projects at all times. My main languages of operation are C++ and Python, however I am spending time learning Rust and Javascript among others. I work a lot with REST API things, Docker things, and have been learning infrastructure as code with Terraform.
* I use Windows as my main operation system of choice but I have plenty of experience in managing Linux systems, both in my own server running Ubuntu Server and on AWS with EC2/ECS.
* I also stream on Twitch.tv with my friends, under the group name Friend Team Inc., and develop software that we need to manage our community such as VodBot, our website, managing game servers, moderation bots, and more.
* I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's Computer Science degree at Purdue University, with plans to specialize in systems software and software engineering. I have also been working an internship over the summer of '22 full-time and into the school year part-time. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out through my email.
